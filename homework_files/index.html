                <th>Here is where the code starts, meaning where features of any app start being developed or features can be modified.
                    Anyway, this means starting with new code or check out existing code from an existing branch
                </th>
                <th>This stage has access to local data or <i>mock data</i> to simulate production data</th>
                <th>
                    Always with a version control to keep changes. This stage is still very <i>"local"</i> meaning 
                    that access here is mostly to everyone but the ones performing changes are developers.
                    <br>
                    Security can be checked with statyic analyzers
                </th>
                <th>Mostly local testing with unit testing (checking functional correctness. Need to apply sunny
                    day testing, rainy day testing and regression testing), Code Quality (is code
                    readable for other developers?) and peer review and their feedback</th>

                <th scope="row">Integration</th>
                <th>
                    Is where the CI server works. This one is triggered by a commit or Pull Request to the version control
                    system. This ensures that when someone says "my code is ready", a not local test is performed to check 
                    all standards are met before merging the new code/existing code with tweaks into the existing code.
                </th>
                <th>It's always done again thorough the version control system (VCS) so it's possible to add/merge 
                    code such that there's a tracking system for versions when something breaks or doesn't work.
                    <br>
                    This part can use syntethic data or parts of real data to test functional correctness.
                </th>
                <th>Since this is the part we are trying to merge code upstream in the structure, access here is mostly to
                    developers so they can check that everything they're doing is working and compliance with standars set 
                    for a staging environment
                </th>
                <th>Testing here is not only for the new developed code but for all parts of the code. This is done to check
                    that the new code didn't break any other part of the program. Basically, saying that the new version is working
                    on it's overall.
                    <br>
                    Testing needs to cover all parts, yet it can't be very large testing because we need it to be fast and have fast
                    feedback.
                </th>
            </tr>

                <th>
                    Purpose of this environment is basically to simulate production environment (real life) to check that
                    everything is working as expected and that UX is consistent. It's triggered by the clean-up of the integration
                    environment.
                </th>
                <th>
                    Data in the environment shoud be a copy of the production database or a large part of it (again, trying to 
                    simulate production environment). When doing this part, sensitive or restricted data must be hidden.
                </th>
                <th>This environment needs to check in its steps that any sensitive data is restricted to the non-target users,
                    meaning that only people/agents with permission can access this type of data.
                    <br>
                    For this part, access is only for responsibles of checking overall functionality of the app, and also,
                    the go/no-go mechanism restricted to those who can make the decision. It has to be traceable to check any issues
                    in the process.
                </th>
                <th>
                    Since it's trying to simulate production, all type of testing needs to be done (load, security, compliance, user)
                    to ensure that the app is working well in all it's aspects.
                </th>
            </tr>

            <!-- Row for Production-->
            <tr>
                <th scope="row">Production</th>
                <th>
                    Is when the app/new features are released to they can be used by real users. It's triggered after the "Go" decision
                    in the staging environment.
                </th>
                <th>
                    Most of the times using versions of the app so users and developers can keep track of release of features
                    complementing the app.
                    <br>
                    Data here is production, using the totality of the resources that are needed for the app to work. Again,
                    restricted data has to be obscured to those who don't have access to it.
                </th>
                <th>
                    Production characterizes for having the code being already in the field. Meaning that security should be
                    working completely with any restricted access working, and possibly with no security breaches.
                </th>
                <th>
                    Testing here is basically the performance of the app in real life: how are the load metrics, queries per second,
                    etc.
                    <br>
                    With the data from this performance metrics, strategic decisions can be done to start plannig for new features
                    that can improve the existing app, meaning that this ones need to start in the development environment,
                    completing the cycle.

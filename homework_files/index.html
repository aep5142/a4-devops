                    Anyway, this means starting with new code or check out existing code from an existing branch

                    Always with a version control to keep changes. This stage is still very <i>"local"</i> meaning 
                    that access here is mostly to everyone but the ones performing changes are developers.
                    <br>
                    Security can be checked with statyic analyzers
                </th>
                <th>Mostly local testing with unit testing (checking functional correctness. Need to apply sunny
                    day testing, rainy day testing and regression testing), Code Quality (is code
                    readable for other developers?) and peer review and their feedback</th>

                <th>
                    Is where the CI server works. This one is triggered by a commit or Pull Request to the version control
                    system. This ensures that when someone says "my code is ready", a not local test is performed to check 
                    all standards are met before merging the new code/existing code with tweaks into the existing code.
                </th>
                <th>It's always done again thorough the version control system (VCS) so it's possible to add/merge 
                    code such that there's a tracking system for versions when something breaks or doesn't work.
                    <br>
                    This part can use syntethic data or parts of real data to test functional correctness.
                </th>
                <th>Since this is the part we are trying to merge code upstream in the structure, access here is mostly to
                    developers so they can check that everything they're doing is working and compliance with standars set 
                    for a staging environment
                </th>
                <th>Testing here is not only for the new developed code but for all parts of the code. This is done to check
                    that the new code didn't break any other part of the program. Basically, saying that the new version is working
                    on it's overall.
                    <br>
                    Testing needs to cover all parts, yet it can't be very large testing because we need it to be fast and have fast
                    feedback.
